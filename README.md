# pseudo-classes

    This is a CSS styling exercise and I need to use preexisting HTML code without adding classes or Ids.

    1. Change the <li> items from block level elements. Add correct styles to remove the bullets and display them as inline elements
    2. The three <span> elements should be displayed as block elements with a 1 pixel border and 25 pixel margin on all sides
    3. In the article element with the class n-child, add a 1 pixel border around every even numbered section element
